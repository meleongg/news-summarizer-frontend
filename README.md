# AI-Powered News Summarizer & Sentiment Analyzer ðŸ“°ðŸ¤–

This project fetches news articles, summarizes them using NLP models, and analyzes sentiment. This is the Next.js and React.js frontend.

## Demo

- Fast API Hugging Face Space Demo: https://meleong-news-summarizer.hf.space/docs#/

## Features

- âœ… Fetch news via API
- âœ… Summarize using Hugging Face `bart-large-cnn`
- âœ… Analyze sentiment with NLTK
- âœ… Simple UI Next.js, React, and ShadCN components

## Local Testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meleongg/news-summarizer-backend.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

In a new terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meleongg/news-summarizer-frontend.git
touch .env # create a new variable called NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL and set it to your localhost backend endpoint
npm run dev
```

## Deployment Challenges & Solutions

### Memory Constraints

- Large NLP models (BART-CNN, NLTK) require significant memory
- Free-tier hosting services (Heroku, Railway) insufficient for model deployment
- Most providers limit memory to 512MB-1GB

### Attempted Solutions

1. **Docker Containerization**

   - Containerized application for consistent deployment
   - Still exceeded free-tier memory limits
   - Tested on Docker Hub and Google Cloud Run

2. **Model Optimization**
   - Attempted model quantization
   - Explored smaller alternative models
   - Trade-off between performance and size

### Current Solution

âœ… Successfully deployed API on Hugging Face Spaces

- Provides adequate memory for models
- Free tier supports ML workloads
- Backend demo at: https://meleong-news-summarizer.hf.space/docs#/

âœ… Successfully deployed Frontend on Vercel

- Automatic deployments from main branch
- Optimized for Next.js applications
- Frontend demo at: https://news-summarizer-frontend.vercel.app/
